consider the following 
    - study about testing the efficiency of using AI for integration of program in COBOL used in banking industry
    - with 3 IV and 1 DV.  
        a. IV tools used    
            NLP to extract logic from existing code and map to new requirement 
            LLM based code - insert new logic into cobol code 
            Symbolic execution - testing efficiency of functionality
        b. DV efficiency of each tool
include the following per section.
    - format, what details should be included in that section, number of words.
